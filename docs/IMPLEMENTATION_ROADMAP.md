## Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests

- [ ] Tag model CRUD operations with user_id
- [ ] Slug generation with user context
- [ ] Tag finding and creation for users
- [ ] Trait methods with user scoping
- [ ] Scope functionality with user filtering
- [ ] Event dispatching

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Full tagging workflow with multiple users
- [ ] User tag isolation
- [ ] Global tag sharing
- [ ] Mixed user+global tag queries
- [ ] Multiple model types with user tags
- [ ] Tag type filtering with users
- [ ] Performance with large datasets and many users
- [ ] Cache functionality with user keys
- [ ] Command execution with user options

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Empty tag arrays
- [ ] Duplicate tags for same user
- [ ] Same tag name for different users
- [ ] Special characters in tag names
- [ ] Very long tag names
- [ ] Concurrent tag operations by different users
- [ ] User deletion cascading to tags
- [ ] Database transaction handling

## Performance Benchmarks

Target performance metrics:

- Tag 1000 items with user context: < 1.5 seconds
- Query 10k tagged items with user filter: < 150ms
- Popular tags calculation per user: < 75ms
- Tag suggestions with user context: < 30ms
- Mixed user+global tag queries: < 100ms

## User Scoping Considerations

### Configuration Options

- `user_scope.enabled` - Enable/disable user scoping
- `user_scope.allow_global_tags` - Allow null user_id tags
- `user_scope.mix_user_and_global` - Include global in user queries

### Query Optimization

- Optimize WHERE user_id = ? OR user_id IS NULL queries
- Consider separate queries and merging in PHP for large datasets
- Cache user-specific and global results separately

### Migration Path

- Support for existing installations without user_id
- Migration guide for adding user scoping to existing tags
- Backward compatibility considerations

## Future Considerations

After initial release:

1. **Tag Sharing** - Share personal tags with specific users or groups
2. **Tag Permissions** - Fine-grained control over tag operations
3. **Team Tags** - Tags shared within teams/organizations
4. **Tag Visibility** - Public/private tag settings
5. **Tag Transfer** - Transfer tag ownership between users
6. **Bulk User Operations** - Tag management across multiple users
7. **Tag Hierarchies with Ownership** - Parent/child relationships with user context
8. **Cross-User Tag Analytics** - Compare tag usage across users
9. **Tag Recommendations** - Suggest tags based on user behavior
